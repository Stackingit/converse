Thing to do in the following order
==================================
( I just dont work on this any where near often enough for me to remember what I am supposed
to be working on :-) )

todo
=====

- make service a Genserver so that I can start the service quickly etc.
- Get converstation update
- Get only conversations that are still open
- allow people who do not exist to be added to a mail so that when they are they can get
  all the mail that they missed before they existed
- when a user stops talking remove from db ( either to listener or entirly )
- Allow people to move to just being a listener
- Make a web page for a client

ideas
=====

* Should the db be based around the user and not the conversation so that look up will
be much faster given that it will always be queried in that context ?


version 0.0
====

- User can add a conversation
